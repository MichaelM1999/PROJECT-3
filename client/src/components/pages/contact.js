            Thank you for visiting our site! You may have already seen that some functions of our app aren't working if done quickly, this is due to us using a free api for this project making it difficult to display all the info we want with limited calls. If you are having problems with a certain function try slowing down to let our api catch up or report this issue to one of the developers below.
